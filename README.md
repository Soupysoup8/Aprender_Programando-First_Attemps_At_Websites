# Forth Assignment

For this assignment I decided to make another website, something that would be a little bit more my style.

I needed to customize the typography for my entire website, so I decided to use Google Fonts to achieve the desired look and feel. To accomplish this, I selected a suitable font and applied it to all relevant elements throughout the site, not just the titles. Whenever necessary, I adjusted the font color and thickness using the available CSS properties to ensure optimal readability and visual harmony.

In addition to typography customization, I wanted to enhance the overall user experience by incorporating custom icons that serve as functional links. I chose three icons, including popular social media platforms and communication channels like WhatsApp. By adding these icons to my site, I made it easier for visitors to connect with me through their preferred channels.

To be honest, the outcome wasn't as good as I wanted it to be, and I felt really frustrated, but at least it's pretty obvious that there this was a big upgrade from my first website.
